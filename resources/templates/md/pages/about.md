Welcome to my blog. I am a recovering lawyer who has decided to make the
jump---from composing briefs with vim and writing scripts to help the paralegal
wrangle documents---to the career path doing what I actually like. Funny idea,
that.

Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/Ethan826), my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-kent-56b14010), and my
[résumé](https://flashbangsplat.com/resume).

### About me

#### Early life and piloting

I grew up in Greensboro, NC, and now live in Oak Park, IL, with my wife and two
kids. I wanted to be a pilot from the age of four, so I went to Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University, where I earned a B.S. in Aeronautical Science (the
degree for aspiring pilots). I eventually caught on as a flight instructor,
first for a large San Diego flight school, then freelance at the flying club
across the street. As my flight time approached that required by the airlines to
apply, I began to realize that flying is fun but soon becomes rote and does not
tap into strengths that I wanted to use in my career. That, and my wife (then my
girlfriend) pointed out that spending half of every month in hotel rooms would
be a bad fit for being a good dad.

I made a list of strengths I wanted to use and further develop---analytical
skills, written communication, and the ability and desire to keep learning new
things---and decided that law fit the bill. I studied hard for the LSAT, got a
good score, and applied. I was delighted to be admitted to Harvard Law School,
and moved to Boston, teaching the LSAT during the transition.

#### Legal career

I loved law school. It was hard, and it developed my ability to approach
problems systematically. One of my best [professors](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=23845)
said that a lawyer’s principal skill is to recursively break a problem into
smaller pieces until it becomes tractable. In the process, a lawyer must become
a subject-matter expert in some tiny domain at the center of the case. That was
exactly the kind of the intellectual process I enjoy using and believe to be
one of my strengths.

When I graduated, I took a job at a large Chicago-based
[firm](https://jenner.com/). It turns out that practicing law is quite different
from being a law student, at least these days. As has been extensively
[documented](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/the-only-job-with-an-industry-devoted-to-helping-people-quit/375199/),
legal practice is actually pretty miserable. It’s not (or not only) the
work-life balance; it’s the zero-sum nature of commercial litigation and how
that creates the deadweight loss of smart and talented people in high-rise
office towers working long hours merely to nullify one another’s work. It’s the
triviality of the problems (who really cares which giant corporation eats the
losses covered by an ambiguous indemnification clause). It’s the fearful,
risk-averse, elitist, pompous culture. It’s the joylessness. It’s the
[cargo-cult lawyering](https://twitter.com/mbutterick/status/105336038343450624).
It’s the well-established partner who used to run---*run*---to the managing
partner’s office several times a week. It’s the fact that I used to love
talking and thinking about law, but practicing broke something inside of me.

#### Technology and programming

I had always been interested in technology. As a Cub Scout, I had a subscription
to *Boy’s Life* magazine. Each issue had a QBasic program at the back,
which I would faithfully type into our MS-DOS computer. In high school, I took
AP Computer Science and (previewing both my programming and lawyering skills),
wrote a TI-83 program that did the quadratic formula, returning the simplified
roots---an approach that the teacher had not thought to ban. During college,
I watched ZDTV religiously and took particular interest in the technologies
used in airliners. As a flight instructor I wrote my own website in Notepad.
And in law school, I worked on the Journal of Law and Technology.

As a lawyer, I did as much to pretend I was a programmer as I could. My
work-issued laptop crawled, so I partitioned it and did most of my work on
Ubuntu. (IT eventually activated BitLocker, which broke GRUB, but I eventually
figured out how to put GRUB on a thumb drive.) I created LaTeX templates for
memos and briefs. And on several occasions, I wrote scripts to automate
time-consuming projects. For example, I was asked to review a set of 29
spreadsheets with over 200,000 rows of data to identify certain kinds of
comments. I wrote a Clojure script to build a unified spreadsheet, filter
against a lengthy regular expression, pull in all related entries, and highlight
the terms that matched. I wrote a Python script to relabel over a thousand
PDF exhibits based on a spreadsheet correlating the exhibits’ Bates numbers
with their exhibit numbers. I am also a member of my [current firm’s](http://www.kelleydrye.com)
technology committee.

I became serious about trying to change careers. I contemplated attending a
bootcamp, but between my student loans and my family, it was not practical.
Instead, I began taking Code School, Linda, and Treehouse courses and reading
books and tutorials. I cast a wide net, dabbling in C, C++, Haskell, OCaml, F#,
and D. I became especially interested in web languages as well as Clojure. As
I became more focused on changing careers, I enrolled in Udacity and completed
their Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree in one month (it’s scheduled as a
six-to-nine month course). Most recently, I built a [diet tracker app](https://flashbangsplat.com/diet-tracker)
to learn Angular 2, Express, and TypeScript.

### Flash Bang Splat

Flash Bang Splat comes from [this list](http://blog.codinghorror.com/ascii-pronunciation-rules-for-programmers/)
of slang names for ASCII characters. Flash (#), Bang (!), Splat (\*) has a nice
ring and tells a short (if ambiguous and possibly woebegone) story.
