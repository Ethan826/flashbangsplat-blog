Over the past few weeks, I built a Diet Tracker app using Angular 2, TypeScript,
Express, and SQLite (the so-called “SEAT stack” (not really)). My wife and I
decided to try to eat more healthfully and so read a diet
[book](http://drdavidludwig.com/) that limits simple carbohydrates. Part of the
book’s program is to keep track of various measures of well being as well as
the number of servings of simple carbohydrates you ate that day. By graphing
the results on a monthly tracker, you can see if eating simple carbohydrates
affects your well being. (I haven’t lost much weight, but I did get to write
a lot of code.)

[Here](https://flashbangsplat.com/diet-tracker) it is.

The app I had in mind was pretty simple from the user’s perspective, but it
gave me the opportunity to learn about several things---

* Angular 2
* TypeScript
* Express
* Session management with JWT and localstore
* Password salting, memory-hard hashing, and storage of credentials
* Setting up an HTTPS server
* Deploying a Node server to Amazon EC2

Since finishing the app, I have decided to move the HTTPS implementation out of
Express and into nginx, so that I can run this blog and that app from the same
address, on which more to come.
